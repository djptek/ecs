      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when

        based on authentication information for the client then this field can be
        used to reflect the outcome of that validation.

        For example if the agent''s connection is authenticated with mTLS and the
        client cert contains the ID of the agent to which the cert was issued then
        the `agent.id` value in events can be checked against the certificate. If
        the values match then `event.agent_id_status: verified` is added to the event,
        otherwise one of the other allowed values should be used.

        If no validation is performed then the field should be omitted.

        The allowed values are:

        `verified` - The `agent.id` field value matches expected value obtained from
        auth metadata.

        `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a

        Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each
